- title: "Bitcoin -- A Technical Introduction"
  date: 2014-02-28
  time: '16:30'
  speaker: Austin Williams
  description: |
     "Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized, peer-to-peer, digital currency and payment system. At its heart is an open source value-transfer protocol that facilitates currency transfers among users without relying on a trusted third party.  The protocol employs provable-cryptography to prevent counterfeiting, censorship, double-spending, and account seizures.

     We'll learn how the bitcoin protocol works, discuss some of its strengths and weaknesses, and dispel some common misperceptions.  No prior knowledge of cryptography is required, but a basic understanding of mathematical functions (ie: surjectivity, injectivity, domains, images, preimages, etc) will be assumed."

     "Austin Williams received his M.S in Mathematics from PSU in December, 2013 and is currently a part-time lecturer in the math department at PSU.  His primary areas of focus are abstract algebra, graph theory, and game theory.  His current research involves classifying the minimal separating sets of surfaces of low genus."

- title: "Stewardship of Open Source Microprojects"
  date: 2014-02-14
  time: '16:30'
  speaker: Spencer Krum and William Van Hevelingen (nibalizer and blkperl)
  description: |
    "System administrators and devops engineers today are writing, sharing, and contributing back to more code than ever before. This has given rise to a new class of Open Source project: the open source microproject. Microprojects are small, specialized pieces of code (often a single script or collection of scripts) that solve a specific problem. Puppet modules, small ruby gems or python programs, anything written in perl, and plugins for just about anything are also in this class of software.

    In the past, these tools were available by trawling through mailing lists for either the script itself or a link to the public ftp of the author. Today, these projects are receiving much better stewardship through freely available open source tools. This talk will describe how to publish your small internal tool or plugin as an opensource microproject, how to set up the free tooling around it to make it easy to use and contribute back to for others, and how to ensure good stewardship of your project in the future after you have given up the reins.

    Spencer and William both began as students at PSU. Now William is the Lead Unix administrator for the CAT and Spencer works in DevOps at UTi Worldwide Inc."

  date: 2014-01-31
  time: '15:15'
  speaker: Terry Speed
  description: | 
    CpG methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark on DNA which plays a key role 
    
    in genomic imprinting, X-inactivation, transcriptional regulation, tissue specificity and carcinogenesis.

    What is co-methylation? Loosely, it is the persistence of the methylated (M) or unmethylated (U) state 
    
    along a chromosome. Slightly more precisely, it is the association between the methylation state at 
    
    nearby CpGs, as a function of their separation. "Co-" here is meant to bring to mind correlation. 
    
    This talk will summarize some results concerning co-methylation we obtained by analysing publicly 
    
    available sequence data on whole genome bisuplhite-treated DNA. Our immediate goal was to see 
    
    whether we can simulate whole-genome methylation data that is indistinguishable from the real thing. 
    
    I'll explain why we want to do this. It turns out to be quite hard (for us).

    Handheld systems, such as smartphones and tablets are now the most 
    common way for people to access and interact with computing services. 
    The demand for application development skills is therefore growing at 
    a breathtaking pace. These skills, however, are multi-­‐ faceted,
    requiring students to master computer science and engineering principles, 
    to learn the details of specific mobile application platforms, and to 
    design artistic and engaging user interfaces that respond to how, where 
    and why handheld applications are used.
    This course will cover the fundamental programming principles, software 
    architecture and user experience considerations underlying handheld software 
    applications and their development environments. To bring these concepts alive, 
    the course will involve in-­‐depth, hands-­‐on examples, implemented in the Android Platform, the fastest growing segment of the handheld system user base. 
    Students will apply these teachings, also using the Android Platform, in 
    laboratory projects and in a large-­‐scale semester project.

    In this talk, we will cover the basics of how to connect an Android device to a MySQL database. The technique used is adaptable to any database server (SQL Server, PostGRES, etc...)

    As you probably know, Android does not have a built in functionality to access remote databases, instead it uses SQLLite, a flat file system.

    However, using Java EE 7 and a simple PHP connectivity script, it is practically trivial to do the basic CRUD operations on a remotely hosted database.

    Bring a laptop with Java 7 and Android SDK with Eclipse installed, and get ready to code. Or just bring yourself, and a sheet will be passed to have the connection code EMAILED to you after the venue.<br />

-  title: Text Lacks Empathy
   date: 2013-05-24
   time: '16:00'
   speaker: Nóirín Plunkett
   description: |
     Have you ever written a nice friendly email and gotten a reply that seems like they read a whole different email?

     In Open Source communities we write to each other all the time, but we.re not really writing, we're speaking with our fingers. Text is our primary way to communicate, but text has problems. Speaking conveys subtle emotional cues that as social animals we rely on; text strips them out. A thoughtful correspondent can put those emotions back, but we're often not thoughtful.

     This talk is about the special problems of textual communication: mitigating them; ensuring that what you mean to say is what is understood; interpreting messages that seem totally out of whack; and increasing empathic bandwidth.

     *About the speaker*

     Nóirín Plunkett is a jack of all trades, and a master of several. By day, she works for Eucalyptus Systems, as a geekEnglish translator, and general force multiplier. She's passionate about community, communication, and collaboration.

     Her open source work epitomizes the saying "if you want something done, ask a busy person": Nóirín cut her teeth on the httpd documentation project at Apache, but soon started running conferences for the Apache Software Foundation . She was involved in setting up the Community Development project, is Org Admin for the Google Summer of Code (with more than 40 students!), and continues to contribute to projects as diverse as Infrastructure and Incubator.

     Nóirín was the first woman on the board of the Apache Software Foundation, and continues to sit on the board of the Open Cloud Initiative. She's also an advisor to The Ada Initiative, supporting women in open technology and culture.

     When she's not online, Nóirín can often be found on the dance floor or down at the pub, although she's also a keen harpist & singer, and an excellent sous chef!

  time: '16:00'
  speaker: 'Selena'
  description: |
    Working in software and with computers means wildly different things depending on who you talk to. In open source, the work spans every aspect of software development - from the marketing and documentation to the troubleshooting end-user systems.<br />
    <br />
    The "community manager" or "organizer" role in open source communities is probably the least-well defined in our industry, but is seen as a crucial part of open source software development. <br />
    <br />
    Selena will talk about her work as a serial user group starter, open source conference circuit speaker, conference organizer and contributor to PostgreSQL - all roles considered part of community management. She\'ll also talk about other kinds of community management roles available at small and large companies, or as a volunteer in an open source project. <br />
    <br />
    SHORT BIO<br />
    Selena is a major contributor to PostgreSQL, she founded and runs the Postgres Open conference and keeps chickens. Selena has been working with open source software for over 15 years. She\'s keynoted at SCALE, DjangoCon and LISA, and regularly gives technical talks about Postgres, open source and trolling. She is currently a data architect at Mozilla, makers of the Firefox browser.'

    Ah, the IT department: Strange coworkers, on-call rotations, no budget for new equipment, and the grim realities of "consultant vs employee".  We'll cover these and a few other situations you can expect to encounter, and potential coping methods.  Of course, before we can consider all that, you have to actually have a job - so we\'ll also talk about ways to make your job hunt more successful:  what's worked for me, what\'s worked for my friends, and (more importantly) what hasn\'t.<br /><br /> About the Speaker:<br /> <br />Gabrielle started out her post-college life as a microbiologist and fell into IT by way of technical writing.  15 or so years later, she still occasionally wonders what exactly she got herself into, but overall she's having a good time.  Currently, she\'s a Systems Engineer with EnterpriseDB, a PostgreSQL company.',

    Tinker Toys are the best illustration of a Git repository I\'ve found. Side-by-side with issuing Git commands, 
    we\'ll build a Git repository out of kid\'s toys to show what\'s going on behind the scenes. 
    Mind bending concepts like remote branches, rebase and the staging area become child.s play.<br />
    <br />
    Basic knowledge of git commands is expected of the audience (init, add, commit, diff, log, push, pull).
    If you.ve started using git, but are uncomfortable with it and don.t really get it, this is for you.<br />
